        <h3>Analog keypad</h3>
        <p>
          This was programmed in C using the Raspberry Pi SDK, FreeRTOS kernel, and TinyUSB libary.
          The circuit schematic was made in KiCad and the switch housing designed in SolidWorks. The
          keyboard switches have magnets which are detected with hall effect sensors to determine their
          positions.

        <h3>Micromouse PD controller parameter tuning</h3>
        <p>
          This is an autonomous maze-solving robot that uses the stm32 Blue Pill. It uses IR sensors and
          motor encoders as inputs to the PD algorithm to control its movement. A floodfill algorithm is
          used to solve the maze.
