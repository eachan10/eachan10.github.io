        <h3>Analog keypad</h3>
        <p class="keypad">
          This was programmed in C using the Raspberry Pi SDK, FreeRTOS kernel, and TinyUSB libary.
          The circuit schematic was made in KiCad and the switch housing designed in SolidWorks. The
          keyboard switches have magnets which are detected with hall effect sensors to determine their
          positions.

        <h3>Micromouse </h3>
        <p class="mm">
          This is an autonomous maze-solving robot that uses the stm32 Blue Pill. It uses IR sensors and
          motor encoders as inputs to the PD algorithm to control its movement. A floodfill algorithm is
          used to solve the maze. This footage was taken while I was tuning the parameters of the PD
          controller

        <h3>Fourier Series approximation</h3>
        <p class="fourier">
          This is a script that finds the fourier series approximation of a function defined in the script
          and displays it with matplotlib. The number of terms in the fourier series approximation can be
          tuned to change the accuracy of the approximation.
